# Plant Disease Detection App using CNN

This Flutter project implements a mobile application for plant disease detection using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app allows users to capture images of plants and then analyzes them to detect any diseases present. Below is a README.md template to guide you in creating the documentation for your GitHub repository.

# Overview

This Flutter application utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for plant disease detection. Users can capture images of plants using their device's camera, and the app will analyze the images to identify any diseases present. The app provides users with real-time feedback on the health status of their plants, helping them take proactive measures to prevent crop damage.

# Features
1. Capture images of plants using the device's camera.
2. Analyze plant images to detect diseases using a pre-trained CNN model.
3. Display real-time results indicating the presence of diseases and their severity.
4. Provide recommendations for treatment or management of detected diseases.

# Installation

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/mohamedbadus/Plant-disease-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Plant-disease-detection`
3. Install dependencies:
`flutter pub get`

# Usage
1. Run the application on an emulator or a connected device:
`flutter run`
2. Use the app to capture images of plants and analyze them for disease detection.
3. View the results provided by the app and take necessary actions based on the detected diseases.
